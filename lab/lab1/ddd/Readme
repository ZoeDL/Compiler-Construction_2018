example.demo, test1.demo, test2.demo
	The test programs in DEMO that our scanner and parser can accept

------
Build:
make
	Use a Makefile to build the scanner and parser.

Execute:
./demo [filename]
	If parse successfully, it will print "Parse Successfully". 
	Otherwise, it will show the error messages and the line number where the errors was found.
	If [filename] is missing, the parser will read from stdin.
