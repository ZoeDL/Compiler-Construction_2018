#An Optimizer for ILOC
#COMP 506, Programming Assignment 2
#Chengyin Liu, cl93

------
opt.cpp
	The optimizer. It will:
		Scan and parse the ILOC code
		Build an internal representation for the ILOC code
    	Perform two optimizations
		Print the transformed ILOC code in a form that can be read and executed by the ILOC simulator

opt
	The executable optimizer built by our program

sim
	The ILOC simulator

*.i
	ILOC source files for testing

*.d 
	The input data files for ILOC program

------
Build:
make
	Use a Makefile to build the optimizer.

Execute:
./opt flags filename
	The flags here can be '-v', '-u', '-v -u', or '-u -v',
	where -v means value numbering, and -u means loop unrolling.
	This will generate an optimized ILOC file with name ['opt' + flags + '_' + filename].

./sim filename
	Read the file and execute the code.
